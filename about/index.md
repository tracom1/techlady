Looking for a community where you can discuss tech and other life issues?  You've come to the right place.

## Things this blog should be used for:

* Sharing tech knowledge
* Sharing life experiences related to tech
* Getting support from other people in the tech realm (male or female)
* Learning markdown and static site hosting (ok, that's mostly me)

I rather reluctantly entered the tech world back in 2011.  When I am not on the command line, I am trying to force feed sugar down my co-workers throats, avoiding gluten, and trying to convince my cat I am better than my husband.
